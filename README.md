# Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present
Analyzed a crime dataset using Python with EDA (heatmaps, KDE, scatter plots), regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), classification (Logistic, KNN, Decision Tree), and unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA). Fixed kernel errors and explored tools like Jupyter, VSCode, and PyCharm for big data handling.
