# Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present
Analyzed a crime dataset using Python with EDA (heatmaps, KDE, scatter plots), regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), classification (Logistic, KNN, Decision Tree), and unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA). Fixed kernel errors and explored tools like Jupyter, VSCode, and PyCharm for big data handling.
🧠 Crime Data Machine Learning Project – Summary
We analyzed a large crime dataset using Python and applied various machine learning techniques step by step:

🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored the structure of the data (dates, areas, crimes, etc.)

Created heatmaps, scatter plots, and KDE plots to show crime hotspots on maps.

Checked trends by year, month, day, and hour.

🧪 2. Regression Models
Linear Regression – predicted values using continuous features.

Ridge & Lasso Regression – improved linear regression using regularization.

🎯 3. Classification Models
Logistic Regression – predicted whether an arrest was made (status_code == 'AA').

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – classified crimes based on neighbors.

Decision Tree Classifier – used rules to classify crimes as arrests or not.

🔍 4. Unsupervised Learning
K-Means Clustering – grouped crimes based on time and location.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – reduced data dimensions for better visualization and clustering.

🛠️ 5. Other Highlights
Solved kernel errors using LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT.

Compared tools: Jupyter (best for EDA), VSCode & PyCharm (great for big data).

Made visualizations more interactive and meaningful.
